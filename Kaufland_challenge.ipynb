    "This notebook creates 10 dummy files with an integer in each line. These have a structure of text_file*.txt where * is the file number. The following code converts this to text files with the structure of (number, number of repeats). Both a serial and parallelised version of this process is presented. Finally, the converted text files are read and combined to give an output in the file \"out_file.txt\" in the form [...,...,...,...] as requested. This process is done sequentially as for a write to be done to file information from all of the input files is required for correct sequential outputs (although the writing of the same number to file repeatedly could be done in parallel if required). Line by line reading of files is done thoughout to minimize memory usage."
